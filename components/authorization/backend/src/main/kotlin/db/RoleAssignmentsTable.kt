/**
 * A database table for storing role assignments to users for hierarchy elements.
 *
 * Roles can be assigned to users on all levels of the hierarchy. An entry in the table stores not only the ID of
 * the element the assignment is about, but also the IDs of all parent elements. This simplifies use cases to
 * inherit permissions down the hierarchy and to find the elements a user has access to.
 *
 * A single entity references exactly one role. There are, however, multiple columns for role references to distinguish
 * between the levels in the hierarchy. This is needed to identify the correct role class which then grants permissions
 * on the different levels. (Since any role can provide permissions on multiple levels, there is no strict 1:1
 * mapping between hierarchy elements and roles. When evaluating permissions, the union of all permissions from all
 * roles on all levels is constructed.)
