/**
 * A class to manage permissions on different levels of the hierarchy.
 *
 * This class controls the effect of role assignments to users and how permissions are inherited through the hierarchy.
 * It implements the following rules:
 * - Role assignments on higher levels in the hierarchy inherit downwards to lower levels. So, if a user is granted
 *   the `WRITER` role on an organization, they automatically have `WRITER` permissions on all products and
 *   repositories within that organization.
 * - Role assignments on lower levels in the hierarchy can widen the permissions inherited from higher levels, but not
 *   restrict them. For example, a `WRITER` role assignment for a user on product level could be turned into an `ADMIN`
 *   role assignment on repository level. However, a `READER` role assignment on repository level would be ignored if
 *   the user already has `WRITER` permissions on the parent product.
 * - Role assignments on lower levels of the hierarchy can trigger implicit permissions on higher levels. So, if a user
 *   has access to a repository, they implicitly have at least `READER` access to the parent product and organization.
 *
 * An instance of this class is created for a given set of role assignments and for a specific set of permissions
 * controlled by a [PermissionChecker]. The functions of this class can then be used to find out on which hierarchy
 * elements these permissions are granted.
