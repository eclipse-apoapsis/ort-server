// Paginated list queries have a "limit" query parameter, which is the maximum number of items to return.
// When the limit is not set, the queries return a default number of items.
// As some components, like the item distribution color bar, require all items to calculate the distribution,
// the limit is set to (an arbitrary) high number to ensure that all items are returned.
// This probably needs to be changed in the future to a more sophisticated solution, e.g., by using a separate query
// to get the distribution of items without fetching all items from back-end, which is costly.
