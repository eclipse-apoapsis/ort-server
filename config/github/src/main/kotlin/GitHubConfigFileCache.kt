 * A class implementing a file cache for data fetched from the GitHub configuration repository.
 *
 * Caching of content downloaded from GitHub should be rather effective, as the revision can be used as a criterion to
 * construct cache keys. It is guaranteed that the data of a specific revision does not change. By applying caching,
 * the number of requests sent to the GitHub REST API can be reduced significantly. This is especially important since
 * there is a rate limit in place (which is by default 5000 API requests per hour).
 *
 * The implementation has to deal with some race conditions. Since the cache is used by multiple JVMs, it has to be
 * ensured that concurrent access does not cause any problems. For instance, if a file which is not yet present in the
 * cache is requested by two JVM instances at the same time, it should be requested from GitHub only once, and it can
 * be read only after it has been fully downloaded. The implementation achieves this by using exclusive and shared
 * locks on the accessed files.
 *
 * Note: This implementation focuses on the specific requirements of [GitHubConfigFileProvider]. It may be possible to
 * extract common functionality of a file-based cache for more generic use cases later.
