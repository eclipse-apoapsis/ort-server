/**
 * A specialized generator class to generate the content of the .netrc file.
 *
 * This generator class produces an entry for the _.netrc_ file for each [InfrastructureService] it is provided. See
 * https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/05/31/netrc-pains/ for a discussion of the format and its limitations. The file
 * written by this class is intended to be read by ORT's _NetRcAuthenticator_ class. As this class does not support
 * any advanced features (e.g. special characters in passwords, quoting, or escaping), those aspects are ignored here
 * as well.
 *
 * For the _.netrc_ file, only the host names of machines are relevant. In case there are multiple infrastructure
 * services defined with URLs pointing to the same host, the credentials of the first one are used; so the order in
 * which services are passed is relevant. (Typically, infrastructure services are defined in configuration files
 * located in the repositories to be analyzed. Hence, it is possible for users to change the order in which the
 * services are listed as necessary.)
