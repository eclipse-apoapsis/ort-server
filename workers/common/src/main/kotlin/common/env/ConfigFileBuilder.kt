/**
 * A helper class supporting the generation of configuration files.
 *
 * This class can be used by concrete generator classes to generate package manager-specific configuration files.
 * The class exposes a [PrintWriter] for generating arbitrary content. It offers some special support for adding the
 * values of secrets to configuration files: This can be done by requesting a [secretRef] for a specific [Secret].
 * This reference is later replaced by the actual value of the secret.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - This class is not thread-safe; a single instance should be used only by a single generator at a time.
 * - The implementation expects that configuration files are not big; therefore, the whole content of the file is
 *   kept in memory before it is written to disk.
