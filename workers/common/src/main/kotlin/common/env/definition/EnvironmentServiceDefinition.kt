/**
 * Definition of a base class for an environment definition that references an [InfrastructureService].
 *
 * An _environment definition_ specifies a configuration that needs to be present when running a specific worker.
 * Environment definitions based on [InfrastructureService]s are typically required to access private repositories
 * whose credentials can be obtained from the service. They can be used to generate package manager-specific
 * configuration files, to tell the package managers from where dependencies can be downloaded and how to authenticate
 * against these repositories.
 *
 * This base class just defines a property for the associated [InfrastructureService]. Concrete subclasses can
 * introduce further properties that are needed to use such a service in a specific context. For instance, when
 * referencing an artifact repository from a Maven _settings.xml_ file, an alias must be defined under which this
 * repository is referenced from the build definition file.
