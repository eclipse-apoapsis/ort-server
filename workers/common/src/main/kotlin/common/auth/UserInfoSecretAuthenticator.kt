/**
 * A special [Authenticator] implementation for authenticating against infrastructure components whose URLs and
 * credentials are defined in the system environment.
 *
 * This implementation looks for environment variables that have the strings _URL_ or _URI_ in their names and whose
 * values are URLs with a user info component. It can handle authentication requests for these URLs (without the
 * user info component) using the credentials defined in the environment. The credentials are resolved against the
 * [InfraSecretResolverFun] function passed to the [create] function. This mechanism allows for a convenient way of
 * configuring services giving administrators full flexibility how they manage their secrets.
 *
 * In case a secret cannot be resolved, the resulting [PasswordAuthentication] contains its name. That way, this class
 * can be used with real credentials passed in the URL as well like ORT's [UserInfoAuthenticator]. However, this
 * typically indicates a problem in the configuration; therefore, a warning is logged in this case.
