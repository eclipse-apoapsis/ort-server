/**
 * Definition of an interface for accessing secrets stored in a specific storage implementation.
 *
 * This interface defines a basic CRUD API for interacting with a storage for secrets. There will be concrete
 * implementations for specific products. The API is reduced to a bare minimum to support a broad range of secret
 * storage implementations.
 *
 * Client code is not intended to use this interface directly. Instead, a wrapper implementation is used that provides
 * a rich API on top of the functions defined here.
