/**
 * A data class that holds information about elements in the hierarchy the current user has access to. A filter
 * instance is created based on the user's permissions and can be used to generate `WHERE` conditions for database
 * queries to only select accessible entities.
 *
 * In ORT Server's role model, permissions granted on higher levels of the hierarchy inherit down to lower levels.
 * Therefore, if a user can access a specific element, the elements below in the hierarchy are accessible as well.
 *
 * There is also the case that an element on a higher level is implicitly accessible because the user has permissions
 * on lower levels. Such elements must be added to results, but not their child elements.
 *
 * All these conditions are reflected by the different properties of this class.
