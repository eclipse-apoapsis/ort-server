/**
 * A data class describing the declaration of an infrastructure service.
 *
 * This class can be used to describe infrastructure services that are referenced during an ORT run. Repositories can
 * contain a configuration file with such declarations; this means that the repositories depend on such services, and
 * they must be taken into account when setting up the build environment.
 *
 * In contrast to the [InfrastructureService] class, objects of this class need to be resolved first before they can
 * be used. This is especially necessary for the secrets they contain, since only the names are stored here. Another
 * difference is that this class does not reference a product or an organization. Service declarations only appear in
 * the context of a concrete repository, and from this context the whole hierarchy can be determined.
