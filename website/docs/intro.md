# Introduction

The [Eclipse Apoapsis](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.apoapsis) ORT Server is a standalone application for the automation of software compliance checks.

It is based on the [OSS Review Toolkit (ORT)](https://oss-review-toolkit.org) which provides:

- Recursive dependency analysis for more than 20 package managers.
- Integration of several vulnerability databases.
- Integration of several license, copyright, and snippet scanners.
- Customizable compliance rules.
- Lots of report formats, including SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs.
- Flexible configuration.

The ORT core functionality is extended with:

- A scalable architecture with Kubernetes integration.
- A REST API to trigger scans and manage data.
- Keycloak integration for authentication and role management.
- A central database to enable data analysis across projects.

The ORT Server developers are also contributors to ORT and both projects work in close collaboration.
