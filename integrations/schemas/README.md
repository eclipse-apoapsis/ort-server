# JSON Schemas

This directory contains JSON schemas for validating and documenting user facing configuration files.

## Using Schemas for Auto-Completion and Validation

The JSON schemas are contributed to the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/) and can be used in various editors to provide auto-completion and validation for the configuration files.

### VS Code

### IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA supports JSON schema validation and auto-completion out of the box.

### VIM/Neovim
